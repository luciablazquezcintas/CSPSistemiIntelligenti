This is my CSP Project! I'm an erasmus student I have a lot of problems with the overlapping. This has helped me to learn how to use CSP for a everyday use.
My repository includes:
the slides to present my project, 
the first report I made,
an Excel with the output 
a Python file with the code.

Requirement
For use the code you should have downloaded and imported the packages constraint, headpq, collections, itertools, os and pandas.
You must have Python 3.7 or higher installed.
To download the packages, you can do so from the terminal by searching for the Python folder. Once you're in that directory in the terminal, use the pip install "package name" command.
pip install python-constraint pandas xlsxwriter

How to Run the Project
Download this repository.
Open a terminal in the directory containing CSPTLucia.py.
Run the script:
python CSPTLucia.py
After execution, you will find the file threebests0.xlsx in the same folder as the script.

The script generates an Excel file with 3 sheets:
One for each optimal schedule.
Each sheet includes:
-A weekly schedule in table format.
-Statistics such as total dead time, building transitions, number of active days, etc.
